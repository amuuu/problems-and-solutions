# Problems and Solutions
This probably happens to everybody that when coding, not everything goes as you expect logically. Like, why the heck such a simple code is not able to access array elements inside a for loop? It's such a simple thing. Where is this segmentation fault coming from???

Things really do get crazy sometimes. There are always bugs that may take from 5 minutes to a few weeks to find the solutions of (at least for me.) I wanted to make use of the time I spend on this bugs and document how I solve them; make them more than just some bugs and create a "reverse Stackoverflow" where instead of getting mean reactions when you ask questions, I'll answer some questions which I've faced, *before* somebody asks them haha!

So the following will be the problems that I've faced by far, all during doing the projects of Funktional Stdo and how I've solved them. I hope these become useful to somebody when they're facing similar problems!
