### P: Polymorphism not working
- Project: [Ava](https://github.com/funktional-stdo/ava)

#### Description:

Suppose `BaseClass` has a bunch of childs and I wanted to have a collection of its child's objects. So naturally I created a list with the `BaseClass` type. Logically, when adding objects to the list polymorphism should happen and when you want to access an object inside the list and call a function of that object, you expect that the function from that **child class** will be called BUT NO. This probably has been one of the most annoying bugs I've ever faced.

#### Solution that worked:

Haven't found a solution yet :)
